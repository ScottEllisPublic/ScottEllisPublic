## Introduction
Hello, I'm Scott Ellis. I've created this GitHub to document my:
- Geospatial Information Science (GIS) projects
- Deep Learning models
- General Data Science projects (in R and Python)
- Publications (coming soon)


## Notes
#### **Note 1:**
I try to make my work as transparent as possible. I learned how to program in an informal setting; primarily through other self-taught programmers. My conventions may not match up with industry standards, but I maintain consistency within my own work. Learning from an amalgamation of script kiddies and Google search results has demonstrated to me the value of comment code; I _will_ over-comment my scripts to make them accessible to others who lack the means to access formal programming education. That being said, there is no replacement for Google. If you don't understand a module/function/piece of my code then Google it. 

#### **Note 2:**
In the same vein, I try to make my publications as accessible as possible. My viewpoint is that the standard practice for publishing is to fill your paper with as much jargon and complexity as possible. I'm not above playing this game, but I also won't compromise my beliefs as an educator. For any publication that I have posted here, there will be a higher-level, common-language version with it's filename beginning with "Layman_".
